# Rootless library-browser operations

The homeserver deployment runs as `sv` without sudo or systemd. The sole
active supervisor is `/home/sv/library-browser/run-library-browser.sh`, which
starts `server.py` with explicit `/plex/Books` and `/plex/Audiobooks` roots,
restarts the child after exit, and uses the atomic directory
`/home/sv/library-browser/watchdog.lock` to prevent duplicate supervisors.

Persistence is provided by these `sv` crontab entries:

```cron
@reboot /home/sv/library-browser/run-library-browser.sh >> /home/sv/library-browser/watchdog.log 2>&1
* * * * * /home/sv/library-browser/run-library-browser.sh >> /home/sv/library-browser/watchdog.log 2>&1
```

The minute-level entry is a recovery check. It exits immediately when the
watchdog lock is held, so it does not create a second listener. The user
systemd unit is intentionally not used because the user manager is unavailable;
when present, stale unit files and `default.target.wants` links are moved to a
timestamped backup under `/home/sv/.config/systemd/user/backups/` rather than
being left as misleading enabled state.

The old port-8090 command and deployment boundaries are recorded in
`/home/sv/library-browser/deployment-rollback.txt`. The watchdog must never
write under either media root, and Caddy, UFW, Fail2ban, and Readarr are
outside this deployment's scope.
